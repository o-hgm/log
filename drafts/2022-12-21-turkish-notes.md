A2A. What do the suffixes "im" "in" and "niz" mean in Turkish?

It'd be nice if there were examples of where these suffixes were seen/used so I could address only those and properly so. I say this because Turkish (re)uses the same sounds in or as different suffixes. It's hard to guess which are meant in the question.

Here's a general list:

    -im as irregular genitive case ending for first person as in
        "ben-im" (my, mine)
        "biz-im" (our, ours)
    -(i)m as possessive suffix for first person singular as in
        "kitab-ım" (my book)
        "kalem-im" (my writing instrument)
        "telefon-um" (my phone)
        "para-m" (my money)
        "süs-üm" (my ornament)
    -(i)m as personal marker on predicates for first person singular as in
        "gel-i-yor-um" (I'm coming)
        "aç-ar-ım" (I [will] open)
        "öksür-dü-m" (I coughed)
        "sev-er-im" (I [will/ intend to / habitually] love)
        "hasta-y-ım" (I'm ill / sick)
    -in as regular genitive case ending for all persons except first as in
        "sen-in" (your, yours)
        "siz-in"(our, ours)
        "o-n-un" (his, her, its, hers)
        "bu-n-un" (of this)
        "o-n-lar-ın" (their, theirs)
    -(i)n as possessive suffix for second person singular as in
        "kulağ-ın" (your ear)
        "ev-in" (your house / home)
        "masa-n" (your table / desk)
        "öpücüğ-ün (your [little] kiss)
        "bot-un" (your boat / boot)

Although "-nı/i/u/üz" is the second person plural marker in Turkish past tenses, the sounds are also part of personal and possessive suffixes for second person plural:

    -niz as personal marker in simple past tense (or compound tense formed with past tense) predicates for second person plural or for polite statements as in
        "güldür-dü-nüz" (You made [someone] laugh)
        "getir-di-niz" (You brought [something])
        "kurut-tu-nuz" (You dried / drained [something])
        "tırman-dı-nız" (You climbed / ascended)
        "yap-mış-tı-nız" (You [reportedly] had done or did [something])
    -siniz as personal marker on predicates for second person plural or for polite statements as in
        “iç-er-siniz” (You [will / intend to / habitually] drink / inhale)
        “konuş-u-yor-sunuz” (You are talking / speaking)
        “gör-ür-sünüz” (You [will] see)
        “bak-acak-sınız” (You will / shall look)
    -iniz as personal marker on imperatives for second person plural or for polite instructions as in
        "çek-iniz" (Pull!)
        "al-ınız" (Take!)
        "at-ınız" (Throw!)
        "gör-ünüz" (See!)
        "uyu-y-unuz"(Sleep!)
    -(i)niz as possessive suffix for second person plural or for polite possessive expressions as in
        "göz-ünüz" (your eye)
        "bahçe-niz" (your garden / yard)
        "bur[u]n-unuz" (your nose)
        "at-ınız" (your horse)
        "kasa-nız" (your safe / vault)
