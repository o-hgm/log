# Apply for Residence Permit

> Most of the information i've gathered came from [Mou's Memento][2]

By default, EU and Turkey allows to travel without visa requirement 90 days every 180 days. 
If you want to continue discovering turkey you may apply for a "Residence Permit for Touristic Purposes".

This is the roadmap i'm following to perform it.

## Summary (TL;DR)

### Documents you need to bring

- [ ] Health insurance contract
- [ ] 4 x Biometric Photos

### Steps

1. Get a turkish SIM card.
2. Apply for health insurance [Here][7]
3. Get 4 Biometric photos.
4. Get a place to live (LOL)
5. Apply for Residence Permit [Here][6]

#### Timeline

1. (25/09/2022) [Day 1]: I arrive to Istanbul, get my SIM card and Health Insurance
2. (30/09/2022) [Day 5]: In Ankara i have an appoinment with Notary to prepare the taahhütname. We need to fix some papers before fill it.
3. (03/10/2022) [Day 8]: Get Biometric photos, prints everything

## Process

### Turkish SIM card

For some of the processes they will ask you for a phone number (i'm not sure if it must be turkish one but, its always a good idea).
In Istanbul they charged me around 350TL for a sim card (Turk Telecom) with 25GB of data.

### Tax ID

Tax ID is a document you need to do some of the processes required (Like open a bank account). Any foreigners with a valid Address may apply 
for Tax ID. The process **can be done online**.

To apply, you need to go [Here][8], click in `Yabancılar İçin Potansiyel Vergi Kimlik Numarası (APPLICATION FOR NON-CITIZEN'S POTENTIAL TAX NUMBER)`.

Some considerations:

* Don't use ñ or hypens, it may fail during form validation.
* The form transform any character you write into uppercase, but it may fail when doing with (i) cause they have two different characters. (This made me crazy). Write your data in UPPERCASE.

If it fails its mostly because wrong data introduced to the system. Once it finish you will be able to obtain your Tax ID document by 
clicking in `Confirmation` link and providing your Passport data.

### Health insurance

Also if you travel as a tourist, a health insurance is a must. First time i traveled to Turkey i got it with [Mondo][3] and BBVA. 

* Mondo charges around 60€ per 1 month, in Egypt they didn't charge me for medical visitation.
* BBVA charges around 50€ per 1 month, they charge 50€ as copay when i went to the hospital.

This time, i'm interested to apply for health insurance with Turkish branched insurance company, a good choice is [Sompo Sigorta][5]. 
As i couldn't do the process online(See 1), i contacted with [Yabangee][1], an organization for foreigners and expat living in Turkey. 

Tarik (tarik at yabangee dot com) contacted me quickly after i sent the request by email. The process is done fully remotely. 

They will ask you for:

* Passport Photo
* Stance Address
* Date of Start

For me (33)(See 2) the health insurance have a cost of (1248TL, around 75€). The insurance includes the following:

> Include insurance features

Once you pay the fee, they'll send you a PDF document with the signed Insurance. You must **print** the contract in color to avoid any 
issue when applying for the residence process.

### Open a Bank account

One of the requirements is that you need to prove enough funds for all the stance in Turkey. This is translated as 500$/month.
Opening a bank account is not a requisite but may be good if you need to probe it.

I've tried to open a bank account in 3 different banks.

* Ziraat Bankası: They told me i've don't have a registered address (after i did my Tax ID).
* BBVA Garanti: They only open accounts for turkish workers
* ING: When they tried, an unknown issue was raised.

At the end i've decided to move my funds to Wise and provide a Fund Report in Turkish and English (No cost).

### Rent an Apartment / Be a guest in someone's house.

To apply for residence one of the requirements is to have valid address and ensure you can live in Turkey during the visa duration. 

To find an Apartment, the most known website is [Sahibinden][10]. 

> Due to the lack of time from my current visa, i decided to register in a friend's house to perform the Process.

### Go to the Notary

You can find lot's of notaries around almost any city in Turkey. In my case i went to:

> T.C. Ankara 21. Noterliği: Meşrutiyet, Atatürk Blv No:109/1, 06420 Çankaya/Ankara 

Here in my case i need to do:

* Passport Notarized Translation: This document can be requested during the Residence process.
* Taahhütname: A Taahhütname is a letter which probes that another turkish citizen will host you during your stance in turkish.

For the passport translation you only need your original passport. The translation cost is (100TL) and the stamp from the notary (200TL).
In the notary i went, the translator office is in front of the Notary.

For the Taahhütname, the host must be registered in the address where you are going to live (This is called Ikamet) and a copy (or photo) of 
your passport. The cost of this is [... i don't know ...].
