## Health Insurance

I've handled the process with Yabangee, they provide easy communication to apply for [Sompo Sigorta](https://www.somposigorta.com.tr/) health insurance.  
The price is 1248TL (33yo, Spanish). Checking Sompo Sigorta [Price Inquiry](https://www.yabancilaricinsaglik.com/en/prim-ogrenme.asp) shows 480TL, 
but i wasn't able to contact them by email. 

## Residence Permit
