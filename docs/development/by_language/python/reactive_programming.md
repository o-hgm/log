# Rx

## Libraries

+ [RxPy](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY): It's the official lib from [Reactive X][1]. It looks maintained. 

> ReactiveX for Python is a fairly complete implementation of Rx with more than 120 operators, and over 1300 passing unit-tests. RxPY is mostly a direct port of RxJS, but also borrows a bit from Rx.NET and RxJava in terms of threading and blocking operators.
